ExcutorService is an interface that provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.

{% highlight java %}
ExcutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	executorService.execute(new Runnable() {
		@Override
		public void run() {
			System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is here!");
		}
	});
}
executorService.shutdown();

// output
// pool-1-thread-1 is create!
// pool-1-thread-2 is create!
// pool-1-thread-4 is create!
// pool-1-thread-3 is create!
// pool-1-thread-5 is create!
// pool-1-thread-6 is create!
// pool-1-thread-7 is create!
// pool-1-thread-8 is create!
// pool-1-thread-9 is create!
// pool-1-thread-10 is create!
{% endhighlight %}

ExcutorService has two methods for shutdown all threads.
{% highlight java %}
//shutdown() method will wait all tasks are executed before terminating
executorService.shutdown();
//shutdownNow() method will terminat
executorService.shutdownNow()
{% endhighlight %}



`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
